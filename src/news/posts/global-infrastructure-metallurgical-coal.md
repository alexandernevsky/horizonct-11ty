Global infrastructure development continues to drive strong fundamentals for metallurgical coal markets. Major construction projects across multiple continents require substantial steel production, creating sustained demand for high-quality coking coal.

## Infrastructure Boom

Several mega-projects are shaping metallurgical coal demand:

### Asia-Pacific Region
- **India's Infrastructure Push**: The country's ambitious infrastructure development program requires millions of tons of steel
- **Southeast Asian Development**: Urbanization and transportation projects across Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand
- **Chinese Belt and Road**: Continued infrastructure investments in partner countries

### Middle East
- **Gulf Cooperation Council Projects**: Vision 2030 initiatives driving construction across GCC nations
- **Urban Development**: New cities and industrial zones requiring extensive steel infrastructure

### Americas
- **United States Infrastructure Bill**: Federal infrastructure investments creating steel demand
- **Latin American Projects**: Mining and energy infrastructure development

## Steel Production Requirements

Metallurgical coal is essential for steel production through the blast furnace process. Key requirements include:

- **Low Ash Content**: Typically below 10% to ensure efficient blast furnace operation
- **Low Sulfur**: Critical for producing high-quality steel
- **High Coking Properties**: Strong caking index for proper coke formation
- **Consistent Quality**: Predictable characteristics for stable steel production
