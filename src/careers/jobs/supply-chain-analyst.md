**About Horizon Commodities Trading Limited**

In the complex world of physical commodities trading, efficiency and reliability are paramount. Horizon Commodities Trading Limited is a Hong Kong-based company specializing in the sourcing and delivery of thermal and metallurgical coal to industrial end-users across Asia. We don't just trade paper; we manage the physical journey of essential resources from mine to market, ensuring energy security for power generation and steel production.

**The Role**

Global coal supply chains are intricate, involving rail, port, and sea logistics, all subject to volatile market conditions and increasing environmental scrutiny. We are seeking a data-driven Supply Chain Analyst to join our team. This role is not about abstract theories; it's about using data to gain actionable insights into the physical movement of bulk commodities, optimizing operations for both cost and environmental performance.

**What We Are Looking For**

In physical trading, clarity is the first step toward optimization. We need someone who can harness operational data to provide a clear view of our end-to-end supply chain. You will dissect every stage—from minehead to discharge port—to identify inefficiencies and quantify performance metrics. This level of transparency is the cornerstone upon which we build our trading strategies and client value propositions.

Your work will serve as the foundation for understanding and improving our supply chain operations, focusing on:

* **Comprehensive Logistics Mapping:** Analyzing rail wagon turnarounds, port terminal dwell times, and vessel voyage data to identify bottlenecks.
* **Quality & Specification Analysis:** Tracking coal quality parameters (CV, Ash, Sulfur) across the supply chain to ensure contract compliance and minimize disputes.
* **Operational Efficiency Metrics:** Quantifying the cost and environmental impact of different logistics corridors to guide strategic decision-making.

With these detailed insights, Horizon can craft strategies that target the most impactful areas for operational improvement and risk mitigation.

**The Right Candidate Will Have**

* **Data Integration Skills:** Ability to integrate disparate data sources (e.g., mine production reports, rail logistics data, shipping manifests) to provide a cohesive view of the physical supply chain.
* **Analytical Mindset:** Capability to pinpoint where operational inefficiencies and costs are highest, providing clear targets for reduction efforts.
* **Actionable Strategy Development:** Aptitude for offering concrete solutions—from optimizing rail car allocation to selecting more efficient shipping routes—turning raw data into actionable strategies that improve our bottom line and service reliability.

**Working at Horizon**

At Horizon, we believe that technology is a powerful tool for managing the realities of the physical coal trade. We are moving beyond traditional, reactive trading models towards a data-informed approach. By analyzing market trends, logistics performance, and quality data, we orchestrate the movement of resources more effectively. This not only conserves resources and reduces waste but also enhances the reliability of supply for our critical industrial clients.

As the global energy market evolves, data-driven insights are our compass. We are redefining efficiency in coal trading, not just by the speed of a deal, but by the precision, reliability, and sustainability of our physical operations.

**Join Us**

In this dynamic landscape, Horizon Commodities Trading Limited stands at the forefront of modernizing physical commodity trading. We integrate market expertise with analytical rigor to empower our business and our clients in actualizing secure and efficient supply chains.

In the pursuit of operational excellence, every optimized shipment is a victory. The journey is complex, but the direction is clear, and with data as our guide, we are building the future of reliable energy supply.
